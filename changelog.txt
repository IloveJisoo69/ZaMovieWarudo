Changed many file structures
- In js/screens, those are the screens that are used to display in the blade files
- The components folder is where most of our react files will be
- The api folder is where we will store our api implmentations
- (Tentative) Maybe a routes folder that contains all our route files
- Added two blade files namely: adminDashboard and userDashboard
- created a new css folder and placed the app.css file there

Implmented user type verification:
- There are two user types: user and admin
- user cannot enter admin pages and vice versa
- there is a guest home page (welcome.blade) where it will just display the movies and that is where the user is able to login and register
- if the user tries to enter an admin page, the user is disconnected and sent back to the guest home page
- edited kernel.php, added UserType.php middleware 
    
Edits made:
- edited the blade files to extend layouts.app that way we can implement the login and register and be able to safetly logout
- added the admin and user dashboard routes to web.php
- removed logo and moved it on the top navbar
- added user seeders and edited the users migration files
